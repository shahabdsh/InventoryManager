Bug: If fields like "type" or "name" are added to schema, they override the base model fields

Searching and filtering items
- Fuzzy search over all fields
- Item type filter
- Specific field filter
- A range slider can be used for number fields
Validation for reserved words in item schema (name, type, schemeId)
- Server-side validation (use fluent validation)
- Show server side errors client side. Field related errors should appear under the respective field.
Have a google style add button at the bottom right corner of screen
Login and authentication system
Location system (each location has separate inventory)
Merge some of the functionality of item and item schema cards
Add admin page where the admin can create new stores
- Creating new stores adds a bunch of template items (hundreds)
Tip/tutorial system

Use pagination on the items list
Abstract mongodb away as much as possible (something like a dbcontext)
Unit tests
Frontend tests

Add readme for running locally
Make better use of bootstrap and make the app mobile friendly
