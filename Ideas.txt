Adding new item
Deleting item
Add schema editor where you can make item types so forms can be auto-created
Item type can be selected from dropdown ("type" on item becomes a schema ID rather than a string)

Use pagination on the items list
Use DTOs in controllers instead of models
Abstract mongodb away as much as possible (something like a dbcontext)
Add tests project
The two controllers for Item and ItemSchema look pretty much identical. Maybe do something cool to reduce redundancy.

Add readme for running locally
