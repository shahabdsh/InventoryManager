Bug: If fields like "type" or "name" are added to schema, they override the base model fields

Use schema id instead of name for item's type
- When a schema is deleted, all of the related items become "untyped" but not deleted
Have a google style add button at the bottom right corner of screen
Login and authentication system
Location system (each location has separate inventory)
Merge some of the functionality of item and item schema cards
Searching and filtering items
- Fuzzy search over all fields
- Item type filter
- Specific field filter
- A range slider can be used for number fields
Add admin page where the admin can create new stores
- Creating new stores adds a bunch of template items (hundreds)
Tip/tutorial system

Use pagination on the items list
Abstract mongodb away as much as possible (something like a dbcontext)
Add tests project
The two controllers for Item and ItemSchema look pretty much identical. Maybe do something cool to reduce redundancy.

Add readme for running locally
Make better use of bootstrap and make the app mobile friendly

Add a clear and concise feature list with pictures to read me. Pay attention to UX so it delivers all the info well
