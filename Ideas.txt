Adding/deleting items
Adding/deleting item schemas
Item type can be selected from dropdown ("type" on item becomes a schema ID rather than a string)
Login and authentication system
Location system (each location has separate inventory)
Merge some of the functionality of item and item schema cards

Use pagination on the items list
Abstract mongodb away as much as possible (something like a dbcontext)
Add tests project
The two controllers for Item and ItemSchema look pretty much identical. Maybe do something cool to reduce redundancy.

Add readme for running locally
