Use DTOs in the rest of Item class and use AutoMapper

Adding new item
Deleting item
Add schema editor where you can make item types so forms can be auto-created
Item type can be selected from dropdown ("type" on item becomes a schema ID rather than a string)
Login and authentication system
Location system (each location has separate inventory)

Use pagination on the items list
Use DTOs in controllers instead of models
Abstract mongodb away as much as possible (something like a dbcontext)
Add tests project
The two controllers for Item and ItemSchema look pretty much identical. Maybe do something cool to reduce redundancy.

Add readme for running locally
