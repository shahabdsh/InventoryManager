Bug: If fields like "type" or "name" are added to schema, they override the base model fields

Validation for reserved words in item schema (name, type, schemeId)
- Server-side validation (use fluent validation)
- Show server side errors client side. Field related errors should appear under the respective field.
Don't let user delete item types if associated items exist
Have a google style add button at the bottom right corner of screen
Login and authentication system
- Entity ownership
  * Add a "CreatedBy" field to entities
Location system (each location has separate inventory)
Merge some of the functionality of item and item schema cards
Add admin page where the admin can create new stores
- Creating new stores adds a bunch of template items (hundreds)
Tip/tutorial system
Use pagination on the items list
Searching and filtering items
- Editing/adding items when a filter is present are buggy
- Allow escape characters so "-" and ":" and ";" can still be used in field names and values
Add auditing for CRUD of entities such as item and schema
Unit tests
Frontend tests
